# Comparative Agricultural Data Analysis: Ireland vs The Netherlands

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of the **Master in Data Analytics** at **CCT College Dublin**, within the following modules:

- Programming for Data Analytics  
- Statistics for Data Analytics  
- Machine Learning for Data Analysis  
- Data Preparation & Visualisation

## Project Overview

This analysis explores and compares agricultural land use trends in **Ireland** and **The Netherlands**, applying modern data analytics techniques. The work includes **data cleaning**, **EDA**, **descriptive and inferential statistics**, **machine learning forecasting models**, and a **sentiment analysis** based on public opinion related to agriculture in Ireland.

The project is structured following the **CRISP-DM methodology** to ensure a systematic and professional analytical process.

## Objectives

- Compare land use, crop diversification, and farm trends between Ireland and the Netherlands.
- Apply statistical methods to validate patterns and test hypotheses.
- Use ML models (Random Forest and Linear Regression) to forecast land use trends.
- Perform sentiment analysis on social media (Reddit) using NLP tools.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for the Irish agricultural sector.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- TextBlob & VADER (for sentiment analysis)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- GridSearchCV for model optimization

## Methodology

- **EDA** to identify trends and outliers in land use data from both countries  
- **Data cleaning and transformation** including handling null values, outliers, and merging multi-source datasets  
- **Descriptive & inferential statistics**: t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, OLS regression, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis  
- **Machine Learning**:  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Linear Regression with F-regression feature selection  
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Reddit data collected via PRAW (API)  
  - TextBlob and VADER models used to classify sentiment regarding Irish agriculture


## Data Sources

- Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO.ie)  
- Statistics Netherlands (CBS.nl)  
- Reddit post: *“What do you think of the current state of the agricultural industry in Ireland?”*  
- GeoJSON and choropleth data from CartographyVectors.com
